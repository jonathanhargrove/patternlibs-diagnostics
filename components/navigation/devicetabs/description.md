We use in-page tabs for viewing multiple systems under a single customer.

Usability guidelines:
* Tabs alternate between views in the same context not to navigate to different areas
* Used when users DO NOT need to see multiple views simultaneously
* Clearly hilite the selected tab (white)

We also include a 'NOTES' button that opens a modal dialog for the user to enter notes on the system ( not to be confused with the notes button next to customer name)
